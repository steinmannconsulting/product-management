# Metrics for Measuring Expected Results of Features

## Purpose
Metrics help quantify the expected results that a feature is intended to deliver. By defining and tracking these metrics, teams can validate the success of a feature, ensure alignment with business goals, and prioritize future work based on measurable outcomes.

## Types of Metrics
The following types of metrics can be used to measure the impact of a feature:

### 1. **Adoption Metrics**
Adoption metrics measure how many users are interacting with or using the feature. They help assess whether the feature is being utilized as intended.
- **Examples:**
  - Percentage of active users adopting a new feature.
  - Number of logins using a newly added authentication method.
  - Users accessing a new reporting dashboard daily.

### 2. **Engagement Metrics**
Engagement metrics assess how deeply and frequently users are interacting with the feature.
- **Examples:**
  - Average time spent on a new feature.
  - Number of actions taken within the feature per session.
  - Frequency of visits to a new feature.

### 3. **Retention Metrics**
Retention metrics measure the feature’s impact on keeping users engaged and returning to the product over time.
- **Examples:**
  - Reduction in churn rate after launching the feature.
  - Increase in user retention within the first 30/60/90 days of the feature's release.

### 4. **Efficiency Metrics**
Efficiency metrics measure time or effort saved by users when using the feature.
- **Examples:**
  - Reduction in task completion time.
  - Decrease in manual steps required for a workflow.
  - Increase in automation rate for a process.

### 5. **Revenue Metrics**
Revenue metrics capture the financial impact of the feature, both directly and indirectly.
- **Examples:**
  - Increase in subscription revenue due to new payment options.
  - Growth in upsell or cross-sell opportunities related to the feature.
  - Percentage of users upgrading to premium plans after using a trial feature.

### 6. **Conversion Metrics**
Conversion metrics measure how effectively a feature leads to desired actions, such as purchases, sign-ups, or upgrades.
- **Examples:**
  - Conversion rate of trial users upgrading to a paid subscription.
  - Number of users completing a signup funnel after interacting with a new feature.
  - Percentage increase in click-through rates (CTR) for a promoted feature.

### 7. **Usage and New Sales Metrics**
Usage metrics focus on the frequency and extent to which a feature is utilized, while sales metrics measure its impact on acquiring new customers.
- **Examples:**
  - Number of sessions or transactions per user tied to a feature.
  - Increase in new customer acquisition attributed to the feature.
  - Number of leads or sales conversions generated through a newly introduced functionality.

### 8. **Support Metrics**
Support metrics measure the feature's impact on reducing support requests and improving user satisfaction.
- **Examples:**
  - Decrease in support tickets related to specific user pain points.
  - Reduction in average response time for support cases.
  - Improvement in customer satisfaction (CSAT) or Net Promoter Score (NPS).

### 9. **Quality Metrics**
Quality metrics measure the reliability and performance of the feature.
- **Examples:**
  - Number of bugs reported post-launch.
  - Feature uptime percentage.
  - Latency improvements or page load time reduction.

### 10. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
NPS measures user satisfaction and loyalty by determining how likely users are to recommend the product or feature to others.
- **Examples:**
  - Increase in NPS score after the release of a feature.
  - Comparing NPS results before and after the feature launch.

### 11. **Rank and Demand Metrics**
These metrics help prioritize features based on user requests, reported issues, or popularity.
- **Examples:**
  - Number of votes or upvotes on a feature request board.
  - Frequency of a feature being requested or reported in support tickets.
  - Rank of the feature compared to others in a product backlog.

## Defining Metrics for Features
When defining metrics for a feature, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Purpose of the Feature**
   - Clarify what problem the feature is solving and what outcome it aims to achieve.

2. **Choose Relevant Metrics**
   - Select one or more metrics that align with the feature’s goals.

3. **Set Baselines and Targets**
   - Measure existing baseline values before launching the feature.
   - Define target outcomes or improvements for the feature.

4. **Track and Analyze Results**
   - Monitor metrics post-launch using analytics tools.
   - Compare results against baseline and target values to evaluate success.
