# Guidelines for Product Management

## Definitions

### Features
- **What Are Features?**  
  Features are individual updates or enhancements to the product that group together multiple user stories under a common purpose. Each feature represents a cohesive unit of marketable value delivered to the user or business.

- **Source Definition** *(Pragmatic Institute)*:  
  *A feature is a function of a product that delivers a specific benefit or solves a particular problem for a target customer.*  
  [Source: Pragmatic Institute - Features and Benefits](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/resources/framework/features-benefits)

- **Examples of Features:**
  - Adding a reporting dashboard to an analytics module.
  - Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for login security.
  - Adding support for Google Wallet Payment flows.
  - Implementing SMS notifications.
  - Introducing multi-language support.
  - Enabling dark mode or theme customization.

- **Why Features Matter:**
  Features provide a way to deliver incremental value to users while maintaining a clear roadmap. They are larger than user stories but smaller than modules, allowing for effective prioritization and tracking.

### Modules
- **What Are Modules?**  
  Modules are specific areas or "Feature Areas" of the application that represent logical groupings of functionalities. Modules serve as structural components of the product and can include features, user stories, bugs, enhancement requests, and support cases.

- **Source Definition** *(SAFe - Scaled Agile Framework)*:  
  *A module (or capability) is a higher-level grouping of features and functionalities that together deliver business value. Modules often align with systems or services within a solution.*  
  [Source: SAFe Framework - Capabilities and Modules](https://scaledagileframework.com/capabilities/)

- **Examples of Modules:**
  - **Authentication**: Login, registration, password recovery.
  - **Analytics**: Dashboards, visualizations, data exports.
  - **Billing**: Subscriptions, payments, invoices.
  - **Notifications**: Email, SMS, and in-app messaging.
  - **User Management**: Roles, permissions, and profiles.
  - **Search and Filtering**: Indexing, advanced filters, and search functionality.
  - **Localization**: Multi-language support and regional customizations.

- **Why Modules Matter:**
  Modules help organize work and streamline tracking across multiple areas of the product. By associating user stories, bugs, and enhancements with modules, teams can:
  - Better prioritize work.
  - Measure the health and quality of specific areas.
  - Improve communication across teams and stakeholders.

### Roles
- **What Are Roles?**  
  Roles, also known as archetypes, are derived by grouping similar user personas who share common needs, behaviors, and goals.

- **Source Definition** *(Nielsen Norman Group - User Archetypes)*:  
  *A role, or archetype, is a generalized representation of user types that describes shared characteristics and goals across multiple personas.*  
  [Source: Nielsen Norman Group - Archetypes and Personas](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/archetypes-personas/)

- **How Roles Relate to Users in User Stories:**  
  User stories are often written from the perspective of a role to ensure clarity and alignment with user goals. By using roles instead of overly specific personas, user stories remain broadly applicable while maintaining focus on key objectives.

- **Examples of Roles and Grouped Personas:**
  - **Administrator**: Represents users who manage settings, permissions, and user access.
    - Personas: IT Admins, Account Managers, Team Leaders.
  - **End User**: Represents the primary product users focused on task completion.
    - Personas: Individual Contributors, Content Creators.
  - **Power User**: Represents advanced users who utilize complex features.
    - Personas: Data Analysts, Workflow Coordinators.

- **Why Roles Matter:**
  - Simplifies the creation of user stories by abstracting user-specific details into broader archetypes.
  - Helps product teams prioritize features that serve the highest-impact roles.
  - Allows for grouping multiple personas into logical segments to streamline research, testing, and development processes.

- **User Story Example:**
  *"As an Administrator, I want to set user permissions so that I can control access to sensitive data."*  
  Here, the role **Administrator** reflects an archetype that may include multiple personas (e.g., IT Admins, Account Managers).

## Tracking Features and Modules

To effectively manage product development and prioritize ROI, ensure that **Features** and **Modules** are consistently tracked across the following areas:

1. **User Stories**  
   - User stories should clearly link to a feature, module, and role to indicate which product area and value unit they address.
   - Example: *"As a user, I want to enable 2FA so that I can secure my account"* → Linked to Feature: *Login Security Update* → Module: *Authentication* → Role: *End User*.

2. **Bugs**  
   - Bugs should always reference the module they belong to for accountability and reporting.
   - Include severity and priority to help with triage.
   - Example: *"2FA code input fails intermittently"* → Module: *Authentication*.

3. **Enhancement Requests**  
   - Requests for improvements should reference both the impacted module and the overarching feature (if applicable).
   - Example: *"Improve loading speed of the analytics dashboard"* → Module: *Analytics* → Feature: *Performance Enhancement for Dashboards*.

4. **Support Cases**  
   - Support cases should be tagged with the corresponding module for reporting and analysis.
   - This helps identify high-activity modules that require attention or improvement.

## Guidelines for Organizing Features and Modules
1. **Feature Grouping**:
   - Combine multiple user stories into a single feature that delivers a unified business or user outcome.
   - Use concise and descriptive names for features.

2. **Module Association**:
   - Each user story, bug, enhancement, and support case must reference its respective module.
   - Maintain a clear and up-to-date list of modules.

3. **Role Assignment**:
   - Link user stories to relevant roles to ensure clarity and focus on user needs.
   - Use roles to guide product decisions and prioritization.

4. **Tracking and Reporting**:
   - Use tools like Jira Components (Modules) and Features (Epics or Initiatives) for organizing work.
   - Regularly review feature progress and module health to align with product goals.
